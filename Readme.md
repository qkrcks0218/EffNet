# Replication Files for Park and Kang (2020)

This Github repository contains replication files for [Park and Kang (2021)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2021.1983437 "IVNet").

## Files

* 1_Simulation.R file reproduces the results in Section 5 of the paper.
* 2_Analysis.R file reproduces the results in Section 6 of the paper.
* 3_function.R contains functions used in 1_Simulation.R and 2_Analysis.R of the paper.
* SimulatedData_Full.RData contains the simulated data set based on the model in Section 5 of the paper.
	* A new simulated data set can be generated by running lines 1-174 of 1_Simulation.R. 

## Folders

* 1_DataResult folder contains csv files made by running 1_Simulation.R with given SimulatedData_Full.RData file. 
	* Different csv files will be generated when a new simulated data set is used. 
* 2_DataResult folder contains DataResult.RData file which contains the data analysis results.
